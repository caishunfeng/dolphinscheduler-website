Default disable cache, and you can enable it by <code>type: caffeine</code>.</p>\n<p>With the config of <a href=\"https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine\">caffeine</a>, you can set the cache size, expire time, etc.</p>\n<h4>Cache Read</h4>\n<p>The cache adopts the annotation <code>@Cacheable</code> of spring-cache and is configured in the mapper layer. For example: <code>TenantMapper</code>.</p>\n<h4>Cache Evict</h4>\n<p>The business data update comes from the api-server, and the cache end is in the master-server. So it is necessary to monitor the data update of the api-server (aspect intercept @CacheEvict), and the master-server will be notified when the cache eviction is required.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the final strategy for cache update comes from the user's expiration strategy configuration in caffeine, so please configure it in conjunction with the business;</p>\n<p>The sequence diagram is shown in the following figure:</p>\n<img src=\"/img/cache-evict.png\" alt=\"cache-evict\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />",
